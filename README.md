Hybroid: Toward Android Malware Detectionand Categorization with Program Code andNetwork Traffic

In this paper, we present Hybroid, a hybrid Android malware detection and categorization solution that utilizes program code structures  as  static  behavioral  features  and  network  traffic  as  dynamic  behavioral features for detection (binary classification) and categorization(multi-label classification). For static analysis, we introduce a natural-language-processing-inspired technique based on function call graph embeddings and design a graph-neural-network-based approach to convert the whole graph structure of an Android app to a vector. For dynamic analysis, we extract network flow features from the raw network traffic by  capturing  each  application’s  network  flow.  Finally, Hybroid utilizes the network flow features combined with the graphs’ vectors to detect and categorize the malware. Our solution demonstrates 97.0% accuracy on average for malware detection and 94.0% accuracy for malware categorization. Also, we report remarkable results in different performance metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC.
